Presented my work "Limitless Path Generation in Virtual Reality" in FC Kohli Day 2021 panel discussion. It was a virtual event attended by Prof Devi Parikh (Assistant Professor in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech) and Viswanathan Anand (Indian chess Grandmaster and former world champion).
