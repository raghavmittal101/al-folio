## Limitless Path Generation System for Unbounded Locomotion in Room-scale Virtual Environment

<img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/simulation_video.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="Limitless path generation system simulation"/>

Locomotion in a room-scale virtual environment is a bounded task because of physical boundaries in the environment. There are several existing methods to solve this issue. Like:
1. Omnidirectional treadmill
2. Redirected walking
3. Haptic feedback based walking
The above mentioned techniques are locomotion techniques.

Our technique is environment centric and not user centric which means our technique focusses on guiding the user instead of being guided by the user. It guides the user by dynamically generating a path in such a way that the user remains within the bounds of the play area.
