Raghav works in the area of human-computer interaction in VR at the Software Engineering Research Center under <a href="https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~raghu.reddy/"> Dr. Raghu Reddy's </a> guidance. Currently, he is developing a novel scene generation technique for unbounded locomotion in room-scale VR. 

His foray into VR started while working as a research assistant at Cognitive Science Lab, IIIT-H. He assisted research students in implementing virtual environments to carry out user studies in spatial cognition. He was working on a project in which they studied the impact of decision making during navigation in a virtual environment on spatial learning. During this time, they planned to implement a study(Chrastil et al., 2013), which they couldn't because of insufficient physical space. He started searching for various techniques to explore virtual environments larger than the physical space. Raghav ideated the concept of dynamically generating paths in a room-scale virtual environment to create a perception of infiniteness to the user. 

Raghav is a morning person 🌄. His day starts with jogging a mile🏃‍♂️, doing yoga and practising musical notes🎶. He is a trained yogi🧘🏽, classical singer and musician. Singing, playing the guitar, tabla, piano and Indian flute sets him out of the crowd.
